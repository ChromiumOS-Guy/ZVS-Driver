# ZVS-Driver
A ZVS Driver (1-Layer) PCB I Designed so I can use a PCB instead of making a mess of wires

PS: I kinda don't know the rotation of the connectors so for all I know they can be turned inwards and not outwards while still usable it whould suck so check first or wait untill I remove this message.
